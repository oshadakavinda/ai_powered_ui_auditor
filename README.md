## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** ≥ 18
- **npm** ≥ 9

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-ui-auditor.git
cd smart-ui-auditor
npm install
```

### Development

#### 1. Frontend (Electron App)
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
This starts the Vite dev server and launches the Electron desktop application automatically.

#### 2. Backend (AI Server)
```bash
source ven/bin/activate
pip install -r server/requirements.txt
python3 -m uvicorn server.main:app --reload --port 8000
```
This starts the FastAPI server required for AI auditing and analysis features.

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Outputs optimized files to `dist/`.
